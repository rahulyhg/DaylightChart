    <section name="Building From the Source Code">
      <subsection name="Maven Build">
        <p>
          Daylight Chart uses Maven 2.0 to build, run unit tests, and create the
          project web-site. Download
          <a href="http://maven.apache.org/">Maven 2.0</a>
          , and run
          <code>mvn install</code>
          to build. Then, use
          <code>mvn eclipse:eclipse</code>
          to regenerate the Eclipse project files.
        </p>
      </subsection>
      <subsection name="Eclipse">
        <p>
          Before importing the Daylight Chart project into Eclipse, make sure
          that you have a successful Maven build. Maven will download all the
          dependencies needed to build Daylight Chart. You will need to define
          one Eclipse Java Classpath Variable,
          <code>M2_REPO</code>
          to point to the Maven 2.0 repository.
        </p>

      <subsection name="Dependencies">
        <p>
          All of the
          <a href="dependencies.html">dependencies</a>
