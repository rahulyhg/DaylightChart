    <section name="Getting Started">
      <subsection name="About">
        Daylight Chart is a program to display sunrise and sunset charts for a whole year
        at any location in the world. Charts can be customized, saved, and printed.
      </subsection>
      <subsection name="Running">
        <p>The steps for running Daylight Chart are:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Download and install <a href="http://www.java.com/en/download/index.jsp">Java</a>
          on your computer, if you do not already have it.</li>
          <li>Download <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=193171">Daylight Chart</a>.
          Just one download file is needed - daylightchart-2.1-distrib.zip.</li>
          <li>Unzip the downloaded zip file into any folder on your computer,
          keeping the internal folder structure intact.</li>
          <li>Run the "daylightchart" command.</li>
        </ol>
      </subsection>
    </section>
    <section name="How-to">
      <subsection name="Save and Load Locations">
        <p>
          Daylight Chart has an option to save the locations list. This list
          will be saved in the Daylight Chart Locations List Format. It can be
          edited in any standard text editor, and loaded back into Daylight Chart.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to the Daylight Chart Locations List Format, the
          Daylight Chart program also supports loading of locations in the
          <a href="http://earth-info.nga.mil/gns/html/cntry_files.html">GNS Country Files</a>
          format. However, the data in the GNS Country Files does not contain daylight savings
          time information, so Daylight Chart will make a best guess of the time zone.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Daylight Chart program can load populated places in the USA in the
          <a href="http://geonames.usgs.gov/domestic/download_data.htm">GNIS file</a> format.
          The data in the GNIS files does not contain daylight savings
          time information,  so Daylight Chart will make a best guess of the time zone.

    <section name="Building From the Source Code">
      <subsection name="Maven Build">
        <p>
          Daylight Chart uses Maven 2.0 to build, run unit
          tests, and create the project web-site. Download
          <a href="http://maven.apache.org/">Maven 2.0</a>,
          and run <code>mvn install</code> to build.
        </p>
      </subsection>
      <subsection name="Eclipse">
        <p>
          Before importing the Daylight Chart project into Eclipse, make sure that
          you have a successful Maven build. Maven will download all the
          dependencies needed to build Daylight Chart. You will need to define
          one Eclipse Java Classpath Variable,
          <code>M2_REPO</code>
          to point to the Maven 2.0 repository.
        </p>
      </subsection>
      <subsection name="Dependencies">
        <p>
        Daylight Chart depends on
